# Modules: Training & Activity Documents

> [!NOTE]
> I haven't yet added any links to the materials. Once we have a publicly-accessible folder on Google Drive with all these materials, I will add the links! (for example, like the setup for 2025 BAW volunteer materials dir)

> [!TIP]
> In addition to direct links to Google Drive documents, we can also put these docs as PDF files inside their respective folders here, if desired.
