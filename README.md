Repository for materials for Neuroscience for All

# Temporary Notes

Currently set to public, but if desired we can switch to private (so that only specified GitHub users can access) and/or move repository to a different location.

We can add folders to hold various types of materials.

**Contents:**
* I created the backbone below based on the resources spreadsheet. We can modify as desired!
* Direct links to each resource will be added below once resource files are uploaded.
* Directory structure created, but folders are empty (no materials uploaded yet). Can modify as desired and modify table of contents to match.
