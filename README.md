## Questions & Discussion

Do you have a question? Something not working right? Want help or feedback? Have an idea or experience to share? We got you!

A couple of options: **issues** or **discussion board**. Not sure where to post? It doesn't really matter which place you choose. Find both tabs at the top of this repository page or linked below:

* [ISSUES board](https://github.com/cathynewman/UAB_Neuroscience_for_All/issues) -- Great for questions and help
* [DISCUSSION board](https://github.com/cathynewman/UAB_Neuroscience_for_All/discussions) -- Great for general discussion

When you create a new issue or discussion post, you can select relevant label(s) on the right sidebar to best categorize your post. (For browsing, you can filter issues or discussions by label.)
