Repository for materials for Neuroscience for All and Brain Awareness Week

# Temporary Notes

Currently set to public, but if desired we can switch to private (so that only specified GitHub users can access) and/or move repository to a different location.

We can add folders to hold various types of materials.

*Contents:*
* I created the backbone below based on the resources spreadsheet. We can modify as desired!
* Direct links to each resource will be added below once resource files are uploaded.
