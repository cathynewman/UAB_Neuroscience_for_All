# Getting to Know your Hearing: Instructions

## Objectives

1. To provide attendees with a general overview of the auditory system (ear and brain)
2. To educate attendees about auditory processing
3. To introduce the concept of memory storage as it relates to auditory information

## Background

### Auditory Perception

The ear is made up of the external ear, middle ear, and inner ear. The external ear includes the pinna, which helps capture sound in the environment. The external ear canal channels sound to the tympanic membrane (eardrum), which separates the external and middle ear. The tympanic membrane and the three middle ear bones, or ossicles (malleus, incus, and stapes), assist in the transfer of sound pressure in air into the fluid- and tissue-filled inner ear.

The inner ear contains both the vestibular system (underlying the sense of balance and equilibrium) and the cochlea (underlying the sense of hearing). One of three fluid compartments in cochlea is called scala media. The scala media contains the sensorineural hair cells that are stimulated by changes in fluid and tissue vibration.

There are two types of hair cells: inner and outer. Inner hair cells are the auditory biotransducers translating sound vibration into neural discharges. The bending of the inner hair cells caused by these vibrations induces a neural-electrical potential that activates a neural response in auditory nerve fibers of the eighth cranial nerve. The outer hair cells serve a different purpose and will not be discussed in this demonstration.

In summary, the structures of the cochlea vibrate in response to sound with a particular vibratory pattern. This vibratory pattern allows the inner hair cells and their connections to the auditory nerve to send signals to the brainstem and brain about the sound's vibration and its frequency content. That is, the traveling wave motion of cochlear vibration helps sort out the frequency content of any sound, so that information about the frequency components of sound is coded in the neural responses being sent to the brainstem and brain.

### Pathway to the Brain

Auditory information travels from the cochlea (inner ear) to the brain stem through auditory nerves. From the brain stem, auditory information travels through the thalamus and then finally to the auditory cortex (in the temporal lobe).

Before the information is ‘passed on,’ the cochlea dissects the sound waves and sorts them via frequency, intensity, and timing (beginning and ending). For example, the louder the sound is, the greater the signal that is sent to the brain. This information is carried to different parts of the auditory cortex to help our brains interpret the sounds we are hearing.

The auditory cortex plays a critical role in our ability to perceive sound. It is thought to be integral to our perception of the fundamental aspects of an auditory stimulus, like the pitch of the sound. But it is also important in various other aspects of sound processing, like determining where in space a sound originates from as well as identifying what might be producing the sound. The auditory cortex is also thought to be involved in higher-level auditory processing, such as recognizing aspects of sound that are specific to speech.

Cells in the auditory cortex are arranged so they form what is known as a tonotopic map. What this means is that different areas of the auditory cortex are involved in processing different sound frequencies. (Frequency, when referring to sound waves, is related to pitch. High frequency sound waves lead to high-pitched sounds.)

Researchers are still trying to understand exactly how our brain takes the sounds we hear, and puts it together (ex: language), but they do know that many areas of the brain work together to facilitate this process. For example, different areas of the brain work together to decode the meaning of works, while another area helps to understand the relationship of words in a single sentence.

### Sensory Memory and Sound

When you hear something, your auditory nerve sends the sound to your brain. It does this by transmitting electrical signals. At this point, the sound is “raw” and unprocessed audio information. Echoic memory (type of sensory memory) occurs when this information is received and held by the brain. Specifically, it’s stored in the primary auditory cortex (PAC), which is found in both hemispheres of the brain.

The information is held in the PAC opposite of the ear that heard the sound. For instance, if you hear a sound in your right ear, the left PAC will hold the memory. But if you hear a sound through both ears, both the left and right PAC will retain the information. After a few seconds, the echoic memory moves into your short-term memory. This is where your brain processes the information and gives meaning to the sound.

## Materials

* Listening Lotto: Sounds at Home [Box Set]
* Listening Lotto: Sounds on the Farm [Box Set]
* Electronic device (for sound files)
* Speaker (or headphones)

Both box sets come with 12-5.5" x 8.5" photo-based game cards with 8 engaging images each, 120 tokens, an audio CD with 29 sounds, and directions in French, English, and Spanish.

## Activity Instructions

Applies to both Sounds at Home or Sounds on the Farm activity

**Manufacturer Instructions:** Kids listen to the soundtracks on the CD and place tokens on the vibrant photos on the game cards that match the sound they hear. With 29 soundtracks of sounds and 12 different cards, each game is a new and fun experience.

**Activity Instructions**
1. Set up sounds files and speaker (and/or headphones) on the table.
2. Spread around ear diagrams/information sheets for attendees to look at.
3. Give each attendee 1-2 bingo boards and 8 tokens (per board).
4. Follow activity instructions listed on the box (follow links above for product description).
   * Candy available as a reward.

**EDUCATE:** Talk about the structure and different parts of the ear and how they work together to allow us to hear the world around us (and the Sounds at Home or Sounds on the Farm). Then talk about how this information moves from the ears to the brain. And then finally, how our memory of the world allows us to recognize these sounds and correctly fill in the bingo boards.

## Take-Home Points
1. Your ear is a complex system that consists of three parts: external ear, middle ear, and inner ear.
2. Cochlea located in the inner year has specialized hair cells that help us detect sound.
3. Sound travels to the auditory cortex via auditory nerves where it is dissected into sounds we recognize based on frequency, intensity, and timing of the sound.
4. Sensory and short-term memory play an important role in sound recognition, storage, and recall.
