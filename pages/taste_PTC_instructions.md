# PTC Paper Activity

## Objectives
* Understand taste perception, from the taste sensation on the tongue to the processing pathway in the cortex.
* Explore the dominant and recessive traits associated with taste perception using PTC paper.

## Background

**Taste sensation:** Taste sensation involves perceiving different taste qualities such as sour, sweet, bitter, salty, and umami (savory, ex: mushroom). Taste buds, where taste receptors are clustered, detect these qualities to identify nutrients maintain electrolyte balance and to avoid ingesting harmful substances.

### Tongue structure & pathway to cortex

The tongue is covered in papillae forming ridges that contain taste buds composed of basal cells, taste receptor cells, and supporting cells. Taste buds are not only located on the tongue, but also on the larynx, pharynx, epiglottis, and soft palate.

The facial nerve (VII) innervates the taste receptor cells in the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, while the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX), innervates the posterior third of the tongue. The larynx, pharynx, epiglottis, and soft palate are innervated by the vagus (X) nerve.

The taste sensation pathway begins with fibers from the facial (VII), glossopharyngeal (IX), or the vagus (X) nerve, which synapse on neurons in the solitary nucleus of the brainstem. Second-order neurons project to the ipsilateral central tegmental tract, followed by the thalamus, and finally to the insular cortex in the primary gustatory cortex.

### Genetics of taste preferences

Individual food preferences significantly influence dietary habits, and these preferences are primarily determined by genetic factors. Variations in taste-receptor genes result in differences in receptor sensitivity. For instance, the *TAS2R38* gene codes for bitter taste receptors and exists in different variants. Some individuals have a variant of *TAS2R38* that enhances tolerance to bitter foods.

Phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) is a bitter compound. People carrying at least one copy of the dominant allele for the *TAS2R38* gene (*T*) are more likely to taste the bitterness of PTC, whereas people carrying two copies of the recessive allele (*t*) will not taste it.

## Materials
* Control paper
* PTC paper

## Activity Instructions

1. Pass out the control strips.
2. Pass out the PTC strips.
   * Tell participants to make sure to not mix up which strip is which.
3. Participants taste control paper.
   * Ask them to describe the taste.
4. Participants taste PTC paper.
   * Ask them to describe the taste.
5. Ask the participants to raise their hand if they can taste the PTC paper.
6. Ask the those who can taste the PTC to rate the bitterness from 1 (less bitter) to 5 (very bitter). Some should rate the bitterness higher than others.
7. Those that have 5, tell them that they are super tasters!

## Educate

Genes are the code that provides the instructions needed to develop your body, like coding for the color of your eyes, your height, or even how things taste. These genetic instructions come in pairs, one copy inherited from your mom and one from your dad. Dominant alleles are expressed even if there is only one copy, while recessive alleles need both copies to be expressed. While we all have similar genes, everyone’s genetics are a little bit different. That is why you and your siblings look similar, but different.

Cells in our body have special jobs, and they use the instructions from our genes to know what to do. Our tongue has little bumps called papillae, and inside these bumps are tastebuds. Inside the tastebuds are taste cells. These cells pick up flavors like sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami (savory). When you eat something, these taste cells pick up the taste, and nerves in the tongue send the signal to an area of the brain called the primary gustatory cortex. This then lets you know what you are tasting.

In this activity, we are testing to see which genotype you may have -- one that lets you taste the bitterness of PTC or one that means you cannot.

## Questions

* Why can some people can taste PTC while others can’t?
  - Those that can taste it have at least one copy of the dominant allele that codes for tasting this bitterness.
* Do you think you have the recessive or dominant trait?
* If you could taste it, do you think your siblings would be able to taste it?
* Are there other compounds that taste different to different individuals?
  - Cilantro. Some people say it tastes like soap!
* What are some advantages and disadvantages of being able to taste or not taste certain things?
  - Advantages: being able to avoid ingesting food that has spoiled, being able to eat tasty food.

Fun fact: Taste buds regenerate about every 10 days!

## Take-Home Points

* The tongue’s structure includes papillae, taste buds, and nerves that send signals to the primary gustatory cortex in the brain.
* There are 5 different types of tastes we can perceive: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami.
* Genetics influence how we taste things and our food preferences.
* Everyone’s genetics are a little different, even among related family members.
