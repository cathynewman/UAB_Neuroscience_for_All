# Miracle Fruit: Changing Sour to Sweet

## Objectives
* Understand how taste receptors can be tricked/altered to produce unexpected sensations.
* By experiencing a real-world example of the psychophysical nature of sensation, participants will understand that the sensation is not in the stimulus itself (sour food), but in the psychological interpretation of that stimulus.

## Background

*Synsepalum dulcificum* is the plant that produces the taste-altering berry known as the **Miracle Berry/Fruit**. The plant itself originates from West Africa, where it is widely used before meals. The active ingredient in the miracle berry/fruit is **miraculin**. Miraculin is a protein that binds to the sweet taste receptors on the tongue, causing sour and bitter foods to taste sweet. These receptors become activated only in the presence of acid, which is found in sour foods. Scientists have yet to discover why miraculin has this effect on certain taste receptors, but one hypothesis is that miraculin briefly alters the shape of the sweet taste receptors, making them temporarily responsive to bitter and sour tastes.

**What is miracle fruit?**\
Miracle fruit is a berry from the plant *Synsepalum dulcificum* that contains a protein called **miraculin**.

**How does it work?**\
Miraculin does not taste sweet, but it binds to sweet taste receptors on the tongue and enhances up to 800 times the sweetness of acidic foods. So, when miraculin comes into contact with acids found in foods, it acts as a "sweetener." You have to try it with acidic (sour) foods or beverages. The best foods to try are citric fruits or juices, strawberries, vinegar, and sour candies.

**The science**\
Miraculin does not activate the sweet taste receptors at a normal pH level, but instead produces an inhibitory effect (blocks the receptors). However, when the pH is lowered (slightly acidic), the binding of miraculin activates the sweet taste receptors, and thus slightly acidic foods (such as lemons and limes) end up tasting sweet.

Miraculin is a glycoprotein (a protein that has a carbohydrate group attached to the polypeptide chain) that has been isolated as the component of the miracle fruit that alters taste. Miraculin is the largest known macromolecule that can influence taste perception.

**Taste receptors and miracle fruit**\
To understand how this protein has the unique ability to change our perception of taste, let’s first consider how our taste buds respond under normal conditions. Our taste buds have several types of receptors that help us discriminate between sweet, sour, bitter, and savory tastes. So, for example, biting into a lime would cause your sour receptors to begin firing, signaling that the flavor you are detecting is sour.

The natural function of a sweet receptor is to detect the presence of simple carbohydrates on the tongue and normally evokes the perception of sweetness. Miraculin binds strongly to these receptors found on the human tongue, rewiring your sweet receptors to identify acids as sugars instead. So now if you were to bite a lime, your sweet receptors would fire, making you perceive a sweet taste rather than sour!

**How long does the effect of miracle fruit last?**\
It varies from person to person. A tablet's effect lasts 15 minutes to 2 hours. The sweetening effect fades as time passes and depends on how much food you eat, the temperature of the food, and the concentration of extract in the tablet.

**Is miracle fruit FDA-approved?**\
Miracle fruit is safe to eat, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has classified the berry as a *food additive*. This means it does not have a GRAS (generally recognized as safe) status. Miracle fruit has been denied by the FDA due to insufficient safety data.

**Potential warnings**\
With preliminary studies suggesting that extracts from the miracle fruit plant may reduce blood sugar levels, it should be used with caution by people at risk of experiencing low blood sugar, such as those with diabetes. This fruit can also affect pH balance and may cause elevated levels of acidity in the blood. It may also lead to heartburn, digestion issues, and other gut related problems if eaten regularly.

**Can miracle fruit help cancer patients eat better?**\
Miracle fruit products are promoted for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Miraculin is said to be able to mask the metallic taste that some patients perceive in their mouths causing them to be averse to eating.

## Materials

* Miracle fruit freeze-dried pieces (1 per participant)
* Sour food items (e.g., lemon or lime juice)
* Small cups for juice
* Nearby trash can
* DRINKING water
* Optional: taste rating sheets

## Set-up Instructions

1. Pre-fill ~20 small cups with the lemon/lime juice (~2 tsp; enough liquid to coat participant's tongue TWICE).
2. Pre-fill ~20 small cups with DRINKING WATER (enough liquid to help participants wash taste out of mouth).
3. Place remaining water/juice bottles nearby (close enough to reset cups, but not directly in front of participants).
4. Place trash can nearby (somewhere close to dispose of used cups or spit out liquids).
5. Lay out diagrams/information sheets for participants to look at.

## Activity Instructions

> [!CAUTION]
> ASK PARENTS ABOUT ALLERGIES BEFORE STARTING ACTIVITY. There do NOT appear to be any known side effects from this berry. However, if participant has any allergies to berries or fruits, they should not consume.

1. Make sure participant's mouth is free of any prior food/drink (provide water cups if they need to rinse their mouth out).
2. Have participant take a small sip of lemon juice.
   * Ask participant what the lemon juice tastes like.
   * Optional: ask participants to rate the lemon juice on the provided sheets.
3. Have participant sip water or swish around mout to clean taste out of mouth.
4. Have participant place one of the freeze-dried miracle fruit pieces on their tongue and chew for 30 seconds while moving the piece around their mouth.
5. Once fruit is fully dissolved, have participant take another sip of lemon juice.
   * Ask them what the lemon juice tastes like now!
   * Optional: ask participant to rate the lemon juice on the provided sheets.

## Take-Home Points

* Our tastebuds can detect five basic tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami (a sort of brothy or meaty taste).
* *Synsepalum dulcificum* (miracle berries) contain miraculin, a molecule that binds to taste buds. In the presence of acidic (sour or bitter) foods, it activates the sweet taste receptors, resulting in the perception of sweet taste.
* Our tastebuds are only one of the ways that our brain interprets the flavour of food. It also factors in how a food smells, how it looks, what temperature it is served at, the texture, and our previous experiences. Our brains are easily confused if you change just one of these factors!
